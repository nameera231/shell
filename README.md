# shell
a simple “shell” program. A shell is an interactive program that allows you to start and manage other programs, serving as a sort of intermediary between you, the OS, and the running processes. When you run a program in the terminal, you are actually interacting with the shell.

This shell (called mysh) will support basic functionality that allows you to run programs in the foreground and background, and to move around the filesystem.(through cd, ls, pwd, etc.)
